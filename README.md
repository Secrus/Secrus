# Hi, I'm Secrus :wave:

I am a programmer, proud Pythonista, open source maintainer and an avid Star Wars nerd. I am also part of the core team maintaining [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), a modern package manager for Python. My favorite things to do is to develop useful CLI tools that make stuff easier for other developers. Currently, I spend most of my time on maintaining Poetry and libraries it uses.
